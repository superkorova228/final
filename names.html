                Perhaps the name for this character was chosen blindly. 
                But "Ergo Proxy" is full of coincidences that, upon closer inspection, reveal themselves to be both meaningful and ambiguous.
            </p>
            <p>
               The name Vincent is associated with the patron saint of winemaking, and its origin is linked to the word "wine" (vino).
               The name Vincent itself is derived from the Latin vinco, meaning "to conquer, overcome, surpass";
               vincens (from the root vincent), meaning "conquering" (present active participle).
               The surname Law translates as "law," "court," "right," or "rule."
               Accordingly, the full name can be translated as follows:
               Vincent Law – "conquering the law," "overcoming the law"; or, alternatively, "surpassing the law," "one who is above the law."
            </p>
            <p>
                Some details in Vincent Law's appearance bring to mind Vincent Valentine, 
                the hero of the famous game "Final Fantasy VII" (as well as the film "Advent Children" and the game "Dirge of Cerberus").

            <p>
                Pino herself and her name play on the character Pinocchio, with whom she shares some physical similarities 
                (Pino looks like a doll) and a common story: turning into a human.
                The name "Pino" sounds like "piano" - the name of the musical instrument she plays... 
                if there is a piano nearby, and in its absence, she plays the melodica, which, however, 
                is only half related to the piano and belongs to the keyboard-wind instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, PINO is an operating system platform for humanoid robots.

            <img src="images/name0401.jpg" alt="daedalus" class="img-fluid character-photo mb-3">
            <p class="text-muted mb-1">"Daedalus" is a Latinized version of the Greek name.</p>
            <p>
                The name Daedalus is an obvious reference to the legendary ancient Greek inventor and builder.
                Besides the name, they both share or are similar to:

                ››› Status as an inventor and scientist, capable of fulfilling any government request.
                ››› Affinity with monsters and beasts: Minotaur and Proxy.
                ››› Ability to influence the birth of new "people" (only the Greek Daedalus had less experience).
                ››› Ariadne's thread, leading out of the Labyrinth, is a ball in the hands of the second Ril.
                ››› Wings and Icarus.
                ››› Limited mobility – but Daedalus Yumeno is kept in Romdo not by the ruler's orders, but rather by power and opportunities he would not have outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                The surname Yumeno can be interpreted as a derivative of 夢 (yume) – “dream, sleep”.

                Raoul Creed – "a man of strong convictions": Director General (President) of the Romdo Security Bureau – Shimin Keibikyoku (市民警備局).
                At the beginning of his career, he was a self-confident official who strictly followed rules and regulations; by the end, he was an atheist.
                He was the one who launched the Ascension rocket, and in doing so, managed to deceive his Entourage-Autoleive, Kristeva, and the entire Council.
            </p>
            <p>
                Raoul Creed is responsible for activating the ADW (New Birth of Man) project, 
                otherwise known as Project Aus Der Wickel – something like “liberation from the diapers”).

            <img src="images/name0601.jpg" alt="monada" class="img-fluid character-photo mb-3">
            <p class="text-muted mb-1">Monad (from the Greek monas, genitive monados – unit, one) 
                is a philosophical term used in a number of philosophical systems to denote the constitutive elements or units of being.</p>
            <p>
                The monad is one of the fundamental concepts of Leibniz's philosophy (Monadology, 1714). 
                He considered the monad to be a simple, closed, active, and thus changing spiritual substance. 
                Monads, endowed with the capacity for distinct perception, are called souls. 
                The rational soul of man is the monad-spirit. 
                According to Leibniz, the entire world is reflected in the monad; 
                in the form of individuality, it contains within itself, as it were, an embryo of infinity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each Proxy's name has a specific meaning, but each Proxy is also a Messenger. 
                Who was Monad if the one she sought (and who sought her) was the Messenger of Death?
                Perhaps Monad Proxy is the Messenger of Love.
