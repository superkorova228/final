                In modern popular culture, the theme of "awakening" was explored in The Matrix by the Wachowski brothers (the protagonist discovers that the world around him is actually a virtual reality created by machines to exploit people).</p>

              <p>Confession is primarily about Vincent's interrogation, during which he proves he "did nothing."
                    Meanwhile, model citizen Reel Meyer loses faith in Romdeau when confronted with an attempt to cover up the "monster" incident.
                    What seemed like a dull and calm truth is actually a lie, but Reel is forced to abandon her search for the real truth.

                    But the series also features another "good citizen" – Raoul Creed, the Director General of the Security Bureau. 
                    He's impeccable, a rule-abiding individual, and, moreover, has dedicated his life to upholding the law... and discovers that following the rules can save no one.
                    In his encounter with the Proxy, he loses everything he holds most dear, including a part of himself – his calm, his respect for the law, his sense of his own power. 
                    His first encounter with the Proxy caused a breakdown in Raoul's integrity, which ultimately led the "worthy citizen" to commit "unworthy" acts.</p>

                    ››› The Palace of Knossos on the island of Crete is also called a labyrinth city – this palace was built by Daedalus on the orders of King Minos.</p>
